# Bookify client

Bookify is a powerful accommodation booking application developed using Angular 17 and several key technologies. It offers a robust platform for users to seamlessly book accommodations, with features such as real-time availability and recommendations.

## Course Information
This project is part of the coursework for the course "Inzenjerstvo klijentskog sloja" (Client-Side Engineering) at [Fakultet Tehničikih Nauka](https://www.ftn.uns.ac.rs/). The goal of the project is to apply the concepts learned during the course and showcase practical skills in developing the client-side of web applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for using, development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- Node.js - Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js. For more information on installing Node.js, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/ "Nodejs.org"). If you are unsure what version of Node.js runs on your system, run `node -v` in a terminal window.
- npm package manager - Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on [npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the [npm client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) command line interface, which is installed with `Node.js` by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a terminal window.
- Angular CLI - To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Note: project is using Angular 17 so we recommend installing that version 

```shell
node -v
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
